# Intro to Dublin Core Metadata

Dublin Core Metadata (hereafter called DC) is a set of 15 properties for
labeling and describing resources. These elements ease the web search
process and make it simpler to have information appear in searches.

15 properties do not all need to be used, but are available categories
and can be repeated or omitted. These elements are:

-   Contributor -- \"An entity responsible for making contributions to
    > the resource\"

-   Coverage -- \"The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the
    > spatial applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under
    > which the resource is relevant\"

-   Creator -- \"An entity primarily responsible for making the
    > resource\"

-   Date -- \"A point or period of time associated with an event in the
    > lifecycle of the resource\"

-   Description -- \"An account of the resource\"

-   Format -- \"The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the
    > resource\"

-   Identifier -- \"An unambiguous reference to the resource within a
    > given context\"

-   Language -- \"A language of the resource\"

-   Publisher -- \"An entity responsible for making the resource
    > available\"

-   Relation -- \"A related resource\"

-   Rights -- \"Information about rights held in and over the resource\"

-   Source -- \"A related resource from which the described resource is
    > derived\"

-   Subject -- \"The topic of the resource\"

-   Title -- \"A name given to the resource\"

-   Type -- \"The nature or genre of the resource\"

Qualified Dublin Core adds three additional elements which may be useful
to a community partner:

-   Audience

-   Provenance

-   RightsHolder

## Audio & Video Storage

-   Embed files in a Omeka site - *do not upload them*

-   If video files are owned by community partner, can store files on a
    > Youtube or Vimeo channel and keep Box for audio, image, and word
    > files

    -   Could also be stored on Box as MP4s

    -   Youtube will result in ads for viewers, while Vimeo will not.

    -   Youtube and Vimeo basic are free, while paid plans for Vimeo are

-   Audio filetype recommendations (most widely supported and easy to
    > embed in Omeka sites):

    -   MP3, AAC

## Exhibit Curation

-   Omeka is designed for exhibit curation and is compatible with DC
    > metadata

-   Wordpress can operate similarly with [[Dublin Core Metadata
    > Generator]{.underline}](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dublin-core-metadata-generator/)
    > plugin (free), but is not designed for exhibit curation

-   Omeka can be used with Wordpress, with Omeka serving as an archive
    > and Wordpress as informational site. Synthesis of platforms would
    > leverage each\'s strengths. Sustaining such a setup would rely on
    > the proficiency of the students in both Wordpress and Omeka.

# Wordpress plugins

-   "Dublin Core Metadata Generator" -
    > [[https://wordpress.org/plugins/dublin-core-metadata-generator/]{.underline}](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dublin-core-metadata-generator/)

    -   "autogenerates the Dublin Core meta tags for all pages, posts
        > and custom taxonomies"

    -   capability of autogenerating keywords from post tags and titles

    -   3 reviews, each gives 5 stars

    -   Described as a super lightweight plug in

-   Dublin core metadata generator -
    > [[https://wordpress.org/plugins/dublin-core-metadata/]{.underline}](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dublin-core-metadata/)

    -   Has banner that it hasn't been tested on last 3 wordpress
        > versions

    -   One review from 2020 is 5 stars while only review with less than
        > 5 stars is from 2017 so maybe not a big deal ?

    -   Seems to do same as other one? "This plugin allows a user to
        > specifiy which parts of the dublin core namespace they wish to
        > use and then adds extra fields to the post / page pages to
        > allow for submissions of this data."

    -   Bad review here: "I just downloaded and installed this plugin
        > and after testing it thoroughly for an entire day, of
        > different environments and WordPress installations, I must say
        > it is completely useless. It does not create any additional
        > fields in posts/pages, nor does it automatically generate any
        > kind of Dublin Core metas. What it does do, instead, is a
        > whole lot of other completely useless things that nobody could
        > possibly need, like for example it allows me to use a
        > shortcode to display Dublin Code IN the page itself, like a
        > text. Also it allows me to do other things, like this option
        > for "Content to modify page / post with (before post content)
        > Don't bother using this, it is a waste of time, a completely
        > useless and irrelevant plugin that does many things except
        > generating Dublin Core metas"

    -   Last option if there is nothing else working

-   Rich Meta in RDFa -
    > [[https://wordpress.org/plugins/rich-meta-in-rdfa/]{.underline}](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rich-meta-in-rdfa/)

    -   "This WordPress plugin allows users to add some Dublin Core data
        > in RDFa within the HTML page of each post."

    > [[https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-seopress/]{.underline}](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-seopress/)

    -   "If you haven't set a meta tag, the plugin automatically
        > generate one from the existing data (post content, excerpt,
        > post tag, featured image, ...)"

    -   For more diverse metadata options maybe?

-   Other options

    -   Github dublin core metadata initiative

        -   Lots of code repositories we could use for a more DIY
            > overhaul?

            > we wanted to simply code it ourselves

    -   Dublin Core for WP -

        -   Links to wordpress plugin that has been defunct since 2021
