# Liniaa

> Timeline Platform, [https://www.liniaa.com](http://www.liniaa.com/)

-   COST: free

-   PROS: can arrange content into categories, collaborative, cloud storage to back up data, can be viewed as a slide show

-   CONS: only 20 timelines supported with the free version with a max of 100MB storage (about 200 pictures), low number of users so liniaa no longer is being developed nor has upgrade options, not as customizable as some of the other options

-   COMPATIBILITY WITH WP: unclear, I think you used to be able to with some of the upgrades but it looks like that is no longer a capability

-   MEDIA OPTIONS: Images and documents such as wordfiles and PDFs

-   DISPLAY OPTIONS: timeline or slideshow

-   HOW IT WORKS: Click "Create new timeline" and then click the + icon to add new posts. These posts won't appear even if you save them until you exit the timeline and reenter, which was confusing.

# Timeline JS

> Timeline Platform, https://timeline.knightlab.com

-   COST: free

-   PROS: can use JSON to make it more customizable (create custom templates and filters), easy to generate timeline quickly

-   CONS: must customize in JSON which is more technically complex than other options, default format is not aesthetically pleasing

-   COMPATIBILITY WITH WP: available as a WP plugin or embed otherwise

-   MEDIA OPTIONS: Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, Dailymotion, Google Maps, Wikipedia, SoundCloud, Document Cloud, etc.

-   DISPLAY OPTIONS: horizontal timeline (unless customized with JSON)

-   HOW IT WORKS: Enter data into a google spreadsheet and the timeline will generate automatically following the instructions found here https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make. It will also generate a code to place into the WP page where you want the timeline to appear.

# WP timeline

> Timeline WP Plugin, https://codecanyon.net/item/wp-timeline-responsive-vertical-and-horizontal-timeline-plugin/17664690?clickid=Rf2XapymjxyLRH4wUx0Mo3b5UkETrOTXx1yTww0&\_ga=2.123912642.950381388.1613946293-1791242802.1613946293

-   COST: \$25 one-time payment

-   PROS: lots of different themes to choose from, aesthetic, reviews say it is really simple to add your own content and customize

-   CONS: must pay to use any of the features

-   COMPATIBILITY WITH WP: plugin

-   MEDIA OPTIONS: video, audio, image, gallery

-   DISPLAY OPTIONS: vertical and horizontal

-   HOW IT WORKS: I wasn't able to test this one since I didn't want to pay for it, but here are the demo pics:

# TimelineExpress

> Timeline WP Plugin, https://wordpress.org/plugins/timeline-express/

-   COST: free with pro version

-   PROS: Specify the timeline announcement excerpt length, customizable color, can sort in ascending or descending, can change the icon in the middle of the timeline

-   CONS: can only include pictures directly on the timeline when in a banner, which crops the picture

-   COMPATIBILITY WITH WP: plugin

-   MEDIA OPTIONS: any media that is able to be imported to wordpress

-   DISPLAY OPTIONS: vertical timeline (ascending or descending)

-   HOW IT WORKS: place shortcode where you want the timeline to appear on the page. If you want the picture to appear on the timeline and not only when you click "Read more," you must set it as the banner image.

# Event Timeline -- Vertical Timeline

> Timeline WP Plugin by richteam, https://wordpress.org/plugins/rich-event-timeline/

-   COST: free with pro version that adds several themes

-   PROS: create unlimited timelines, 12 themes, customizable color themes, intuitive and easy to use

-   CONS: some of the pictures weren't loading properly that I attempted
    to insert

-   COMPATIBILITY WITH WP: plugin

-   MEDIA OPTIONS: YouTube and Vimeo

-   DISPLAY OPTIONS: all vertical (I believe) but different themes

-   HOW IT WORKS: Place shortcode where you want the timeline to appear on the page. I tested it with style 8 and chose a random color.
