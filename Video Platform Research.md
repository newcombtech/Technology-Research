Pros:

-   creates searchable, auto-transcript

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   preserves speaker view and chats

-   password protected

-   set link expiration

-   viewers can download

-   If you share the recording, Zoom will create a web page where
    > visitors can view the cloud recording.

Cons:

-   required paid subscription (but I think Tulane pays for this)

-   can't directly integrate with attendify

## YouTube

Pros:

-   integrate with attendify (although this feature is intended for
    > streaming pre-recorded video during an event, not sure how long it
    > will be available)

-   Addressing the privacy of videos:

    -   How can I restrict access to my Youtube sessions? Can I hide the
        > ability for attendees to open Youtube sessions directly from
        > Youtube? - You can restrict access to any sessions on
        > Attendify with the help of the following functionality:
        > [[Session
        > Registration]{.underline}](https://help.attendify.com/en/articles/3399221-attendify-session-registration-overview),
        > [[Personalized
        > Schedule]{.underline}](https://help.attendify.com/en/articles/441341-personalized-schedules),
        > [[Hidden
        > Schedule]{.underline}](https://help.attendify.com/en/articles/502616-feature-visibility)
        > feature. However, it is not possible to remove the ability for
        > attendees to copy the Youtube stream or video link

Cons:

-   can't post a private YouTube video - must be unlisted (an unlisted
    > video is accessible by link only, so theoretically attendees could
    > copy and share the YouTube link)

## **Vimeo**

Integration]{.underline}](https://help.attendify.com/en/articles/4578996-vimeo-integration#3-frequently-asked-questions)

Pros:

-   more private than YouTube

    -   Q2: Can I remove the ability for attendees to copy the Vimeo
        > link from within Attendify, to exclude the possibility they
        > will share the link with non-attendees?

    -   A: Yes, you can do that for Vimeo videos and recorded streams.
        > Just use the following Vimeo video/stream settings:

    -   Under Who can watch? Privacy Settings please select Hide from
        > vimeo.com option (any but Who can watch?: \"Anyone\" settings
        > support share button removal).

    -   Under Embed \> Actions settings please disable Share and Embed
        > options.

    -   Please customize your Vimeo Interaction Tools \> End Screen.
        > Your End Screen and overall Interaction Tools settings must
        > not include [Share
        > Options](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/229326167-Share-features#:~:text=You%20cannot%20hide%20the%20%22Share,pages%20of%20their%20private%20videos.).

-   Directly integrate with attendify

Cons:

-   Not sure about the longevity of the videos. Need to make sure that
    > the conference information of Attendify will still be accessible
    > after the conference is over. If the content is stored
    > permanently, then this won't be an issue, but we need to make sure
    > that the conference materials are still available via Attendify
    > after the conference is over.

There's minimal information about Wistia, and conference attendees are
probably not as familiar with it, so I think that Vimeo would be much
easier.
