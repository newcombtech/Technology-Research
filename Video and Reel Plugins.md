# All-in-One Video Gallery

> *Video, Team Plugins360, [https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-video-gallery/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-video-gallery/)*

-   COST: Free with pro version

-   PROS: can group videos by categories or tags to make them
     searchable, videos may loop or autoplay or play muted, subtitles

-   CONS: must upgrade to pro to support certain video formats

-   TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY: No coding necessary, very simple to embed from
    Vimeo

-   VIDEO/PHOTO FORMAT: MP4, WebM, OGV, embeds players such as YouTube,
     Vimeo, Dailymotion, Facebook, or embed code from other third party
     video players

-   DISPLAY OPTIONS: grid, list

-   HOW IT WORKS: When I tested it, you had the option to input videos
     from a website (ex Vimeo) or upload from your computer. It
     supported one or multiple in the form of a gallery. It then
     generates a Shortcode to paste into the post/page where you want
     the video to be located or you can do it by going directly to "Video Gallery\>Add new" in the
Wordpress Admin. Step-by- Step instructions are here:

# Image Horizontal Reel Slide Show

> *Photo Reel, Gopi Ramasamy, [http://www.gopiplus.com/work/2011/05/08/wordpress-plugin-image-horizontal-reel-scroll-slideshow/](http://www.gopiplus.com/work/2011/05/08/wordpress-plugin-image-horizontal-reel-scroll-slideshow/)*

-   COST: Free

-   PROS: option to add hyperlink to images, can put the images on the
     page or in the sidebar, manual can edit the height, speed,
     background color, gap, and order

-   CONS: less customizable, must hold the mouse over the images if you
     want the banner to stop moving, less aesthetically pleasing

-   TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY: Simple, use the shortcode format found here to
     embed into a page or post:
     http://www.gopiplus.com/work/2011/05/08/wordpress-plugin-image-horizontal-reel-scroll-slideshow/

-   VIDEO/PHOTO FORMAT: slideshow of pictures

-   DISPLAY OPTIONS: rolling banner, pauses if the mouse is held over an
    image

-   HOW IT WORKS: I tested this my placing the slideshow as a widget in
     the sidebar, which can be done by going to widgets and then
     dragging "Image Horizontal Reel Slide Show" to the sidebar menu.
     It was pretty small and the images were difficult to see. If you
     do it this way, it appears on every page so it would be better to
    embed it directly on the page you want it to appear on. I also
    tried embedding it with the shortcode pasted on the page, which
     created a slideshow the width of the page.

(also available in a vertical reel)

# Envira Gallery

-   COST: Free with pro version

-   PROS: drag and drop gallery builder, easy to customize and create
     your own layouts, sync from adobe lightroom, free version supports
     Vimeo

-   CONS: unclear which features require the pro version, but it appears
     social media integration is a pro feature, can only upload one
     image at a time

-   TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY: simple, save as a draft to generate shortcode
     that can be pasted onto the page

-   VIDEO/PHOTO FORMAT: photo or Vimeo/YouTube

-   DISPLAY OPTIONS: gallery with customizable dimensions and number of
    columns

-   HOW IT WORKS: I only tested this with photos, but it claims to also
     support Vimeo and Youtube. In WordPress Admin, go to "Envira
     Gallery\> Add New" to customize your post. You can upload photo
     content directly from the photo library on Wordpress or from your
     device. There are a lot of features below that allow you to
     personalize your gallery by adding captions, changing the
     dimensions, It also generates a shortcode that you can then paste
     onto the page where you want the gallery to appear.

-   PROS: aesthetic, easy to customize the dimensions of the photos and
     videos in the grid, can add links to the photos so that viewers
     are redirected when they click on the photo

     additional layouts, ability to link photos to a hyperlink, forced
     people to go Pro in the past by disabling the main plugin
     functionality

-   TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY: Simple, generates shortcode to paste onto
    page/post

-   VIDEO/PHOTO FORMAT: (lite version) YouTube and Vimeo

     the photo library on Wordpress and customize the appearance there.

gallery to appear. It looked a lot nicer with a gallery or a horizontal
video than vertical videos.

# WP Video Lightbox

> *Video, Tips and Tricks HQ and Ruhul Amin,
 https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-video-lightbox/*

-   PROS: disable suggested videos (at the end of a YouTube video),
     automatically generates thumbnail that the user can click to start
     the video, adjust opacity, resizing,

    template, the automatic thumbnail didn't seem to work

-   HOW IT WORKS: After activating, in WordPress Admin Settings, enable
     "pretty pictures" under the lightbox tab. Then, (for Vimeo) you
     can edit one of the two shortcode formats to create the shortcode
     for your page:

    -   [video_lightbox_vimeo5 video_id=\"13562192\" width=\"640\"
         height=\"480\" anchor=\"click here to open vimeo video\"\]

        - This inserts a link to the video on the text of your choice.

    -  [video_lightbox_vimeo5 video_id=\"13562192\" width=\"640\"
     height=\"480\"
     anchor=\"<http://www.example.com/images/vimeo-thumb.jpg>\"\]

        - This inserts a thumbnail that can be clicked on to play the video.
    
After customizing the shortcode, you can paste in onto the page/post
where you want the video to appear.
