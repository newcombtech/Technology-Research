-   COST: Free with pro version

-   PROS: can group videos by categories or tags to make them
    > searchable, videos may loop or autoplay or play muted, subtitles

-   CONS: must upgrade to pro to support certain video formats

-   TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY: No coding necessary, very simple to embed from
    Vimeo

    > Vimeo, Dailymotion, Facebook, or embed code from other third party
    > video players

-   DISPLAY OPTIONS: grid, list

-   HOW IT WORKS: When I tested it, you had the option to input videos
    > from a website (ex Vimeo) or upload from your computer. It
    > supported one or multiple in the form of a gallery. It then
    > generates a Shortcode to paste into the post/page where you want
    > the video to be located or

you can do it by going directly to "Video Gallery\>Add new" in the
Wordpress Admin. Step-by- Step instructions are here:

> [[horizontal-reel-scroll-slideshow/]{.underline}](http://www.gopiplus.com/work/2011/05/08/wordpress-plugin-image-horizontal-reel-scroll-slideshow/)*

-   COST: Free

-   PROS: option to add hyperlink to images, can put the images on the
    > page or in the sidebar, manual can edit the height, speed,
    > background color, gap, and order

-   CONS: less customizable, must hold the mouse over the images if you
    > want the banner to stop moving, less aesthetically pleasing

-   TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY: Simple, use the shortcode format found here to
    > embed into a page or post:
    > <http://www.gopiplus.com/work/2011/05/08/wordpress-plugin-image-horizontal-reel->
    > scroll-slideshow/

-   VIDEO/PHOTO FORMAT: slideshow of pictures

-   DISPLAY OPTIONS: rolling banner, pauses if the mouse is held over an
    image

-   HOW IT WORKS: I tested this my placing the slideshow as a widget in
    > the sidebar, which can be done by going to widgets and then
    > dragging "Image Horizontal Reel Slide Show" to the sidebar menu.
    > It was pretty small and the images were difficult to see. If you
    > do it this way, it appears on every page so it would be better to
    > embed it directly on the page you want it to appear on. I also
    > tried embedding it with the shortcode pasted on the page, which
    > created a slideshow the width of the page.

(also available in a vertical reel)

    > for your page:

    -   \[video_lightbox_vimeo5 video_id=\"13562192\" width=\"640\"
        > height=\"480\" anchor=\"click here to open vimeo video\"\]

    > height=\"480\"
    > anchor=\"<http://www.example.com/images/vimeo-thumb.jpg>\"\]

> This inserts a thumbnail that can be clicked on to play the video.

After customizing the shortcode, you can paste in onto the page/post
where you want the video to appear.
