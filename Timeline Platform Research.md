# Liniaa

> *Timeline Platform,
> [[https://w](http://www.liniaa.com/)ww.lini[aa.com](http://www.liniaa.com/)]{.underline}*

-   COST: free

-   PROS: can arrange content into categories, collaborative, cloud
    > storage to back up data, can be viewed as a slide show

-   CONS: only 20 timelines supported with the free version with a max
    > of 100MB storage (about 200 pictures), low number of users so
    > liniaa no longer is being developed nor has upgrade options, not
    > as customizable as some of the other options

-   COMPATIBILITY WITH WP: unclear, I think you used to be able to with
    > some of the upgrades but it looks like that is no longer a
    > capability

-   MEDIA OPTIONS: Images and documents such as wordfiles and PDFs

-   DISPLAY OPTIONS: timeline or slideshow

-   HOW IT WORKS: Click "Create new timeline" and then click the + icon
    > to add new posts. These posts won't appear even if you save them
    > until you exit the timeline and reenter, which was confusing.

# Timeline JS

> *Timeline Platform, [https://timeline.knightlab.com]{.underline}*

-   COST: free

-   PROS: can use JSON to make it more customizable (create custom
    > templates and filters), easy to generate timeline quickly

-   CONS: must customize in JSON which is more technically complex than
    > other options, default format is not aesthetically pleasing

-   COMPATIBILITY WITH WP: available as a WP plugin or embed otherwise

-   MEDIA OPTIONS: Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, Dailymotion,
    > Google Maps, Wikipedia, SoundCloud, Document Cloud, etc.

-   DISPLAY OPTIONS: horizontal timeline (unless customized with JSON)

-   HOW IT WORKS: Enter data into a google spreadsheet and the timeline
    > will generate automatically following the instructions found here:
    > [https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make]{.underline}. It will also
    > generate a code to place into the WP page where you want the
    > timeline to appear.

# TimelineExpress

-   PROS: Specify the timeline announcement excerpt length, customizable
    > color, can sort in ascending or descending, can change the icon in
    > the middle of the timeline

    > banner, which crops the picture
